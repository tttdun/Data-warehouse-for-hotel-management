# DataWarehouse_Term2_The third year
This is the final project that my team of four members implemented for our Data Warehouse course in the second semester of our third year at HCMUTE.

The aim of the project is to build a data warehouse to manage hotel operations efficiently.

The data warehouse is designed with two fact tables:
- FactBookings (manage all of rooms in hotel)
- FactSales (manage sales of hotel)
# The tool We used
- SSIS
- Power BI
# The resource We used
- High-Level-Dimensional-Modeling-Workbook-Hotel
- Detailed-Dimensional-Modeling-Workbook-KimballU
# How to implement ETL progress in SSIS
- Important: You need install a tool named 'SSIS' in Visual Studio
- First, import the file named 'Hotel' into Microsoft SQL Server to create a raw database.
- Second, create an other database to store database during etl progress
- Third, open my source named 'HotelETL' in Visual Studio and update the connection settings for each action as needed.
- Finally, excute file named 'Package.dtsx' to perform ETL processing
